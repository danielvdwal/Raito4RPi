## Introduction
Raito4RPi stands for **Raito** (jap: Light) for **R**aspberry**Pi**.
It uses [pi4j](https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j) to control different kinds of components like RGB-LEDs or Stepper Motors via the GPIO-Pins of a RaspberryPi.

Raito4RPi should provide a REST-Interface so that it can be used from other devices or projects, like JiraAlerts
